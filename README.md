# Beat Mix

## Project Overview

In this project, I wrote functions to implement logic for a beat-making music machine. This application can loop over a 16-step grid of four drum types and play them when they are activated. It includes functionality to invert each row of drums, clear each row of drums, or clear the entire board. It also includes the functionality to retrieve and save presets to a server.


## How To Begin

To start, download the starting code for this project <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/PRO/skill-paths/backend-javascript/projects/beat-mix/project-2-beat-mix-start.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. After downloading the zip folder, double click it to uncompress it and access the contents of this project.

To get the application started, first open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. You'll have to have your server running to ensure that the code you write runs correctly and that you get to hear your drum beats! You can end your server process with a Ctrl + C shortcut in the terminal window.

To see the application in its initial, non-working state, simply open **index.html** in a web browser.
